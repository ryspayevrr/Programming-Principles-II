# Modifying strings

# Upper and lower methods which return the string in upper/lower case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())

# strip() method which removes white spaces from the beginning or the end

a = " Hello, World! "

# Replacing a string with another string

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))


# Splitting a string by a separator

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']


# String concatenate

c = a + b
print(c)

# If need a space

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
